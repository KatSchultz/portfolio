            Iâ€™m a web developer dedicated to crafting memorable customer
            experiences by pairing the right widgets with the right stores. Each
            merchant brings their own vision, and I genuinely enjoy diving into
            those custom requests that push creativity and problem-solving.

            My journey began in interior design, photography, and real estate,
            so I naturally see websites as digital environments. Like a
            well-styled room, a great site should be thoughfully designed and
            engaging.
